# Ada

An Apple-esque Hacker News client for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

## About

Ada (named for [Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace)) is a native iOS app to browse [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

With this app, you are able to browse the top, best, and new stories on Hacker News while also upvoting and commenting on stories².

## Why?

There are *a lot* of Hacker News apps on the App Store. Despite this, I decided to build this and throw it into the sea of apps that do exactly the same thing.

This project is primarily a learning experience for me. I have always wanted to build iOS apps and this felt like a great opportunity to learn. However, I also want to build an app that people can use and enjoy.
