Because almost everything â€” all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

There is no reason not to follow your heart.\"<p>June 12th 2005 Stanford commencement speech<p>Text: <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html</a><p>Video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc</a>", parent: 3078128, kids: [3078481, 3078271, 3078665, 3078443, 3078326, 3078307, 3078524, 3078240, 3078661, 3079756, 3079746, 3078365])
